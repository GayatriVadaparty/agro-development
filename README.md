# agro-development
In this project, you will be introduced to quantum computing at a high level with Qiskit. 
This includes how to set up your problem definition as a quadratic program.It uses some of optimisation algorithms.
Here, I solved a simple agricultural optimization problem on the choice of crops for a farm, with the goal of increasing the yield. 
This project focuses on access to food, an important problem for World.I believe we could even solve some problems in the world like faminine, poverty, employment with some experience on real Quantum computer.
